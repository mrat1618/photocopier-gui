pCopy-GUI
=====

This is the GUI version of [`pCopy`](https://github.com/mrat1618/photo-copier). It reads JPG files in a folder (i.e. files reviewed by a customer), regardless of the file name changes and then isolates/copies the RAW files that have the same name to a separate folder (i.e. to help with the editing process).
